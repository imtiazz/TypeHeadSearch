# Typeahead Search using Trie in Java

This repository contains an implementation of Typeahead search functionality using a Trie data structure in Java. Typeahead search is a predictive search feature that suggests possible matches to a user's query as they type, providing real-time search suggestions.

## Features

- **Trie Data Structure**: Implements a Trie data structure for efficient prefix-based search.
- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Provides autocomplete suggestions based on the user's input prefix.
- **Real-time Search**: Delivers search suggestions in real-time as the user types.
- **Customizable Suggestions**: Supports customization of suggestion criteria, such as maximum number of suggestions and suggestion ranking.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design the system with scalability in mind, allowing for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language for implementation.
- Maven: Dependency management and project build.
- [Optional: Additional libraries or tools used for testing, performance optimization, etc.]

## Getting Started

To explore and use the Typeahead search implementation using Trie in Java, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typeahead-search-java.git
